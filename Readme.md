## Keepr

Keepr is a social network that allows users to visually share, and discover new interests by posting (known as 'keeping' on Keepr) images or videos to their own or others' collections (i.e. a collection of 'vaults,' usually with a common theme) and browsing what other users have kept. 

The basic idea here is to allow users to post items if they are logged in. They can also browse all of the items (aka keeps) that have been posted without having to login. If any user wants to store a reference to any paticular keep they will store it in the `vault` of their choice. 

We want to give the users the opportunity to click on the keep icon for any post and have a list of their vaults appear. Selecting the vault should create a reference to that post and the users vault.

For example I may really like game art and thus I would be a user who creates a vault named ***Sweet Game Art*** I will then start saving the `keeps` I like into this vault.
